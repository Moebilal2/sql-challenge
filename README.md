# sql-challenge
## Introduction
This is a research project on employees of a corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

In this project, tables were designed to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis were performed.

CSV files are:
-Departments.csv
-Dept_emp.csv
-Dept_manager.csv
-Employees.csv
-Salaries.csv
-Titles.csv
